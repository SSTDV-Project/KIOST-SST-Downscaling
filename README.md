## Project guideline
Any public project SHOULD include:
* MIT License @ `LICENSE`
* Acknowledgement @ `README.md`
* BibTeX citation + link to PDF file @ `README`, if the project is accompanied with a research paper

Any public project SHOULD NOT include:
* Private data, undisclosed data, data with limited accessibility
  - Preferably, *any* data should be hosted outside of the repository.
* Personal information
  - *Unintended* personal information of researchers and developers within source code
  - Device IP address, password, secrets, file path, ...

Any Public project is encouraged to include:
* Project pages (GitHub pages or other platform)

## Dataset

* KAM Weather Data Service 'Open MET Data Portal'
* Ocean Observation - Sea Surface Temperature(SST) 
* https://data.kma.go.kr/data/sea/selectBuoyRltmList.do?pgmNo=52


## Requirements

First, install PyTorch meeting your environment (at least 1.7):
```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
```

Then, use the following command to install the rest of the libraries:
```bash
pip install tqdm ninja h5py kornia matplotlib pandas sklearn scipy seaborn wandb PyYaml click requests pyspng imageio-ffmpeg timm
```

## Features

- **Model:** Two models of LSTM and Transformer are applied to extreme value analysis. For the extreme value analysis, three methods of data transformation, Frechet and Gumbel extreme distribution loss (Zhang et al.,2021) are applied to two models.  
- **Time-series:** 16 time series of sea surface temperature (SST) around the waters of Korea Peninsula are used and the data can be freely access through KAM Weather Data Service 'Open MET Data Portal'. 
- **Gumbel Generalize Value Loss:** 4 cases of Gumbel distribution function according to the hyper parameter r are applied (r=1.0, 1.1, 1.5, 2.0). 
- **Freceht Generalize Value Loss:** 4 cases of Frechet distribution function according to the hyper parameters of a and s are applied. (a=10 s=1.7, a=13 s=1.7, a=15 s=1.7, a=15 s=2.0)
